        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          As a startup founder myself, I know most founders don't understand how to hire a photographer or what they need for their business. I've been there too.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          I built Founder Stop to demystify the process. No complicated jargon, no confusing packages, no uncertainty about what you're getting. Just clear, simple photography services specifically designed for what startups actually need.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700">
          Whether it's a LinkedIn headshot for your personal brand, team photos for your careers page, or professional shots for a funding announcement, I've structured everything to be straightforward and aligned with your actual needs.
