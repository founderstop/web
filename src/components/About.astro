        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          I'm Robert Ross, the founder of <a href="https://firehydrant.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-primary hover:underline">FireHydrant</a>, an engineer at heart, and a recovering on-call engineer who knows all too well the chaos of those 3AM incident pages.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          When I'm not building software to help teams manage incidents, I unwind from the startup hustle by stepping behind the camera. Photography has become my creative outlet—a perfect contrast to the structured world of code and engineering.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          I started Founder Stop because I understand what founders need. As someone who's been through investor pitches, press releases, and company profiles, I know how important quality images are—and how confusing it can be to figure out what you actually need.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700">
          My approach is straightforward: one simple package that gives you exactly what you need. No complicated options or technical jargon—just professional photography that makes you and your company look great.
